## Quickstart

```bash
pnpm create astro@latest --template aholbreich/astro-tailwind-daisyui-starter
```

Or clone directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aholbreich/astro-tailwind-daisyui-starter.git my-project
cd my-project
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## What this is

This repository is a production-ready Astro starter.

It is opinionated enough to be useful, but small enough to understand quickly.
It offers strong defaults and a small number of focused escape hatches.
It is meant to be friendly to both experienced developers and newcomers who want a clear starting point they can control.

It keeps the stack focused on purpose:

- Astro 6 for the site shell and content-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS 4 for styling
- DaisyUI 5 as the default UI layer
- Alpine JS only where a few lines of client-side behavior are useful

The goal is simple: start quickly, keep control, and ship without unnecessary setup friction.

### Choose this if

- You want a clean Astro starter with strong defaults instead of a blank repo.
- You want DaisyUI included on purpose.
- You want blog/content support, sitemap, SEO basics, icons, dark mode, and accessibility basics already wired up.
- You want example pages and components that are easy to delete.
- You want something production-usable immediately without becoming a large scaffolding system.

### Skip this if

- You want a theme, landing page kit, or large component gallery.
- You want a generator with many install-time choices.
- You want auth, database, API, CMS, or app-style state management included from the start.

## Included

- Astro 6
- Tailwind CSS 4 via `@tailwindcss/vite`
- DaisyUI 5 as the default UI layer
- Alpine JS for small enhancements only
- Typed blog content collection with Markdown and MDX support
- Tailwind Typography plugin for blog/article content
- SEO meta component, sitemap, and `robots.txt`
- `astro-icon` with local SVG icons
- Inter configured through Astro 6's fonts API with a checked-in local variable font
- Dark mode toggle with no flash on first paint
- Accessibility basics including skip link and reduced-motion support
- Static output by default, adapter-free until you actually need one
- GitHub Actions CI for `astro check` and build

## Intentionally not included

- A theme or page builder
- A large starter option matrix
- Authentication
- Database or API layer
- Analytics or tracking
- Multiple UI frameworks
- A heavy component library beyond DaisyUI

Astro 6 requires Node `22.12.0` or newer. The repository includes an `.nvmrc`
with that baseline.

Set your public site metadata in `.env`:

```bash
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
PUBLIC_TWITTER_HANDLE=@yourhandle
```

Astro validates these values in `astro.config.mjs`, then the starter reuses
them in `src/site-config.ts` for sitemap, canonical URLs, and social metadata.

## Starter shape

This starter is meant to be understandable at a glance:

- One site config file: `src/site-config.ts`
- One base layout: `src/layouts/Layout.astro`
- A small set of components you can keep or delete
- A minimal blog collection in `src/content/blog/`
- A single DaisyUI reference page you can keep, adapt, or delete

## Main customization points

### `src/site-config.ts`

Update the site title, description, navigation, footer text, and social metadata.
The production URL and default Twitter handle come from validated public env
vars so they stay aligned with Astro's `site` config.

### `src/styles/theme.css`

Adjust DaisyUI and theme tokens. If you want to move away from DaisyUI later, this is one of the main files you will touch.

### Fonts

The starter uses Astro 6's fonts API end to end:

- `astro.config.mjs` registers the local Inter variable font and exposes `--font-inter`
- `src/layouts/Layout.astro` loads it with `<Font cssVariable="--font-inter" />`
- `src/styles/fonts.css` maps that variable to Tailwind's `--font-sans`

That means Tailwind utilities and DaisyUI components both inherit the same
font without extra component-level setup.

This separation is intentional:

- Astro handles font sourcing, optimization, and the CSS variable
- Tailwind uses that variable as the shared sans-serif token
- DaisyUI inherits the Tailwind font token through the normal component styles

### `src/layouts/Layout.astro`

Update the HTML shell, view transitions, metadata defaults, and theme bootstrapping.

### `astro.config.mjs`

Set the final `site` URL. Add a deployment adapter only if your target platform
or runtime needs one.

## Blog support

Posts live in `src/content/blog/`. The included sample posts are meant to show
real Markdown/MDX usage, including images, video embeds, and code blocks.

Add a post like this:

```md
---
title: My first post
description: A short summary shown in listings and meta tags.
pubDate: 2024-06-01
draft: false
---

Your content here.
```

## Deployment

The starter builds as a plain static Astro site by default.

That keeps the template portable and easier to understand. If you later need
platform-specific SSR, image services, edge runtime support, or other adapter
features, add the relevant adapter for your deployment target at that point.

Set `site` in `astro.config.mjs` to your production URL so sitemap and canonical URLs are correct.

## Release flow

This repository uses semver.

```bash
pnpm release:patch
pnpm release:minor
pnpm release:major
git push && git push --tags
```

The local release script checks that:

- you are on `main`
- the working tree is clean
- `CHANGELOG.md` still has an `Unreleased` section
- `pnpm check` passes
- `pnpm build` passes

It then asks for confirmation and runs `pnpm version` for you. The pushed tag triggers the GitHub release workflow.
